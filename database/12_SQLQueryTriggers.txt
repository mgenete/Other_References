/*
INSERTED & DELETED tables
INSERTED and DELETED virtual tables contain the "before" and "after" images of the rows. 
INSERTED table contains the "after" images (the new/incoming data). A row exists in INSERTED only if it was part of INSERT statement or if it is changed in the UPDATE statement.

DELETED has the overwritten/deleted rows. A row exists in DELETED only it was part of an UPDATE statement or if it was actually DELETEd
UPDATE statement populates both: INSERTED contains the new values and DELETED contains the over-written or current values
